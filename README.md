# Curriculum Vitae of Failures
   
Most of our lives are made up of small failures, but those failures are often invisible, while successes are always visible. In this way, I decided to register the curriculum of my failures to "suit the balance". This curriculum was based on the [CV of Failures from Johannes Haushofer (2016)](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/Johannes_Haushofer_CV_of_Failures.pdf)". _Success is built on 99 percent failure._" (Soichiro Honda) - Enjoy!
